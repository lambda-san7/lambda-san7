### Lambda

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting back on the Github grind
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to not write shitty code 
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing right now
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my cat
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: don't
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I hate rustup but Ferris was a gift from Jesus himself
